# PLAN
Pico Labs Affiliate Network

## Origins
Several factors contribute to this idea.
1. Many earlier experiments by others, resulting in the web application category Social Media, each one of which is a silo'd network.
2. Inspired by the blog post "[Fundamental Features of Persistent Compute Objects](https://www.windley.com/archives/2013/10/fundamental_features_of_persistent_compute_objects.shtml)", which is what picos are.
3. A desire to operate a pico engine that provides picos to all comers, as hinted at in a blog post, "[How to make money hosting picos](https://picostack.blogspot.com/2023/06/how-to-make-money-hosting-picos.html)".
4. An earlier experiment using self-sovereign identity for sign up and log in purposes, known as Pico Labs Network.
5. An earlier experiment using picos to implement a [fully-sharded database](https://github.com/Picolab/fully-sharded-database), with one pico per entity, known as Calling Me By Name.
6. The idea of using picos as a web application development stack, as exposed in the blog, "[PicoStack](https://picostack.org/)".
7. The hope that one day a pico will be able to move from one pico engine host to another.

## The plan (pun intended)

1. Host an instance of the latest pico engine at PLAN.picolabs.io with some static assets, including
2. an index page that invites people to affiliate with the network, asking only a valid email address as an identifier.
3. Once affiliated, the person controls a pico which includes a ruleset holding their network identifier.
4. The person is free to add personal rulesets to their pico, making it their own _personal computer in the cloud_.
5. The person can export their pico in order to arrange for it to be hosted on some other pico engine.
