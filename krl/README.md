# PLAN rulesets

The rulesets in this folder serve several purposes:
1. Some implement the PLAN system itself
2. Some are standard applications installed in every affiliate pico
3. Some are sample applications available for installation by affiliates into their picos
4. Finally, some really ought to be elsewhere
