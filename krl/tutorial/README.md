# Tutorial

These rulesets follow along with the [tutorial](https://picostack.blogspot.com/2023/07/tutorial-for-new-application.html).

An alert reader will notice that these rulesets break with the convention for naming KRL files, 
using the RID as the filename and `.krl` as the file extention.

This is because we are archiving here the same ruleset at different times in its construction,
to match the progress dictated by the tutorial.

Each version can be installed in the Manage applications page, which will see it as one ruleset, identified by its RID.
